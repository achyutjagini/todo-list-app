
This is an HTML document that creates a simple "to-do" list application.

It includes a form with an input field for adding tasks, and an unordered list
to display the tasks. The list items include Font Awesome icons for indicating
a task has been completed or for deleting a task. The document also includes links to a CSS
stylesheet and a JavaScript file for handling the functionality of the application.


This block of code includes several meta tags that provide information about the document and
its presentation.

The first meta tag sets the character encoding for the document to UTF-8. This ensures that any special 
characters in the HTML, such as accented letters or non-Latin characters, are displayed correctly.
The second meta tag tells Internet Explorer to use the latest version of its rendering engine, instead 
of an older version that may not support all of the HTML and CSS used in the document.
The third meta tag sets the viewport, which is the area of the browser window that is used to display the
web page. The "width=device-width" part sets the width of the viewport to the width
 of the device screen.
The "initial-scale=1.0" part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded
 by the browser. This 
is useful for ensuring that the page is properly scaled on mobile devices.


Together, these tags help ensure that the page is properly displayed and
rendered on different devices and browser.


This line of code links to a CSS file called "style.css" in the same directory 
as the HTML file.This file is used 
to define the styling and layout of the elements in the HTML document. The CSS styles defined
in this file will be 
applied to the elements in the HTML, allowing for control over things like colors, font sizes,
spacing, and more. 
This makes it easy to separate the presentation from the structure of the document, 
making it 
easier to maintain 
and modify the style without affecting the HTML.


<input type="text" class="input" 
placeholder="Enter your task"
autocomplete="off"/>

This is an HTML code snippet for an input field of type "text". The input field has a 
class of "input" and a placeholder text of "Enter your task". 
The autocomplete attribute
is set to "off" which means that the browser will not automatically fill in 
values for the input field.


const formEl = document.querySelector(".form");

const inputEl = document.querySelector(".input");

const ulEl = document.querySelector(".list");

This is JavaScript code that is selecting elements from the DOM (Document Object Model) 
using the querySelector() method.

const formEl = document.querySelector(".form"); will select the first element that 
matches the class "form" and assigns it to the variable formEl.

const inputEl = document.querySelector(".input"); will select the first element that
matches the class "input" and assigns it to the variable inputEl.

const ulEl = document.querySelector(".list"); will select the first element that
matches the class "list" and assigns it to the variable ulEl.

The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches the specified CSS class.
These variables can be used to manipulate the selected elements in the DOM.

let list = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("list"));
if (list) {
  list.forEach((task) => { toDoList(task);
  });
}

This code is retrieving data from the browser's localStorage using the getItem() method 
and parsing it into a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(). The localStorage.getItem("list") 
returns the value of the "list" key in the localStorage, which is a string, so it's parsed into
a JavaScript object and assigned to the list variable.

Then, it checks if the list variable is truth, which means that it has a value and it's not
null, undefined or []. If the list variable is truth, it will iterate over the list using 
forEach() method and call the toDoList(task) function passing the task as the argument.

This code snippet is likely used to display the list items that were previously stored in 
the browser's local storage on page load.



localStorage is a property of the window object in JavaScript that allows you to store key-value pairs 
of data in the browser's storage. The data stored in localStorage is only accessible from the same origin
as the website that stored it and is persistent across browser sessions, meaning it will not be deleted 
when the browser is closed.

localStorage allows you to store strings, and it's commonly used to store JSON data after stringifying 
it. The setItem() method is used to add key-value pairs to localStorage, and the getItem() method is
used to retrieve the value of a key. You can also use the removeItem() method to delete a key-value 
pair, or the clear() method to remove all data.

Note that localStorage has a storage limit of about 5-10 MB depending on the browser, so it should
not be used to store large amounts of data.


let list = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("list"));

This code is retrieving data from the browser's localStorage using the getItem() method 
and parsing it 
into a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(). The localStorage.getItem("list") method returns
the value 
of the "list" key in the localStorage, which is a string, so it's parsed into a JavaScript
object and assigned to the list variable.

JSON.parse() is a method that takes a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object. 
This
allows the data to be easily manipulated and accessed like a normal JavaScript object.

This code is likely used to retrieve a list of items that was previously stored in the browser's 
local storage. Once the data has been retrieved and parsed, it can be used in the JavaScript code 
to display the list or perform other actions on it.
